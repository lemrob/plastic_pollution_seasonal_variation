# Data Folder: Instructions for Running Code

This folder contains local datasets needed to run the project.

## ðŸ”’ Git Ignored

This folder is **excluded from version control** via `.gitignore`, so data files must be added manually by each user.

## ðŸ“¥ Expected Files

Please ensure the following files are added locally

- `river_shapes.geojson`
- `waste_data.csv`
- `model_outputs.pkl`

These files are required by scripts in `/app` and `/notebooks`.
