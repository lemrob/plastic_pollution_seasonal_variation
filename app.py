    Ocean Cleanup researchers found: **the top 1000 polluting rivers are responsible for 80% of the plastic pollution** entering  the ocean from rivers.
    \n\n They built a model to better understand the levels of pollution from these rivers.
    \n\n The **map visualisation** for their predictions can be found here: https://theoceancleanup.com/sources/ 
    \n\n For each river, their model predicts the **annual** levels of pollution.
    """

    MY_MODEL_paragraph = """
    This **baseline model** introduces **seasonality** into the paradigm, by considering **rainfall**.
    \n\n This influences pollution rates as shown in the first part of the model (below) – through **Mobilization**.
    \n\n Focuses on the top 10 polluters in **South East Asia** – a high polluting area with dramatic seasonal shifts in rainfall.
    \n\n Aggregates historical rainfall patterns to predict the **average monthly** pollution levels of each river.
    """

    AREAS_FOR_ENHANCEMENT_paragraph = """
    This is a **baseline** model, which can be extended in various ways:
    \n\n 1. Collecting data for **each step of the model** shown below for a more accurate prediction of the **probability of plastic emission** per river  starting with **wind data* to complete the **Mobilization** step.
    \n\n 2. Collecting data for Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) – shown below.
    \n\n 3. Proximity to Large cities and areas of human activity.
    \n\n 4. **Time-series predictions**:  can long-term climate and economic data be used to predict trends in river pollution? This could serve particularly useful when considering where to place interceptors.
